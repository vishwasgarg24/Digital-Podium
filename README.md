# Digital-Podium
This is a podium whose height can be adjusted as per the requirement of the person, who is using it.
The major issue which arises while using a Podium is that if the height of a person is not normal than using a Podium becomes nothing more than an embarrassing moment and the whole presentation will be spoiled Getting the idea from there the idea of this project was evolved.
It has a moving top which can adjust up and down for 6 inches. It has additional features such as Visualizer, Multiple ports for attaching auxiliaries and another system for projecting.

Also, it has a stylus-based touchscreen display by which the presenter can explain his topic easily. Along with this, it has a full set mike set for giving presentations.
The whole podium is controlled by a 3.5-inch Nextion display attached at the top of the podium and for protecting the full assembly, an RFID based lock is given in the top sliding of the podium.
